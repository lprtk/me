<p align="justify">If you are curious, like me, here is a little description of me. 👀<p>

<p align="justify">🧑🎓 After a Bachelor's degree in Economics and a Master's degree in Econometrics and Statistics, I am currently in a Master's degree in Data Science in a French university.<p>

<p align="justify">💻🌱 Aspiring Data Scientist, I really enjoy working with unstructured data. Here are some of the topics I find very attractive and on which I have worked: textual data analysis and modeling (NLP); sentiment analysis; early detection of diseases from medical images or prediction and prevention of diseases using Machine and Deep Learning; identification of defects in industrial parts based on images. In addition, I like to work on time series with Deep Learning to make complex predictions. In particular, I like to discover new concepts for forecasting time series such as Deep Hybrid Learning.<p>
